## 🙆‍♀️「私について」 About Me
* 🔊 With 13 years of audio design experience, I’ve worked across short films, TVCs, local films, and most recently, AAA titles at Ubisoft. I led sound design for Skull & Bones, from production through its live-game phase (1st year), delivering immersive audio that supports gameplay and narrative. <br>
* 🎧 At Ubisoft, I handle SFX creation, integration, pipeline development, and feature innovation—while mentoring peers and ensuring mixes meet industry standards. I specialise in Wwise, Steinberg Nuendo, and using tech creatively to solve complex audio problems. <br>
* 🎓 Nearing graduation with a double major in 💻Computer Science and 🎮Games Design at Murdoch University, I bring extra value through skills in project management, programming, ML, and software development—blending tech with artistry in every project. <br>
* 🛠️ I've also developed two mini-games in Unity, expanding my understanding of game dev beyond audio and into the player’s experience as a whole. <br>
