## 🙆‍♀️「私について」 About Me
* 🎧 With 13 years in sound design, I blend hands-on creativity with technical know-how across AAA titles, local films & commercials. At Ubisoft, I’ve led new feature audio from concept to implementation, planning sound design, shaping pipelines while mentoring teammates to hit both quality & timeline goals. <br>
* 🛠️ Skilled in Wwise, Nuendo & Game Engines (Unity), I’ve also scripted C# tools to streamline workflows & support cross-discipline collaboration. <br>
* 🎓 Graduating with a double major in Computer Science and Games Design, where I built a speech emotion recognition ML model & developed two Unity mini-games while managing teams, I’ve expanded my understanding of game dev beyond just audio. <br>
